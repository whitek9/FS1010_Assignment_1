# FS1010_Assignment_1

## Assignment requirements

- [x] "Open Sans" from Google Fonts - regular and bold
- [] An approximately 1100px wide wrapper or container (this doesn't absolutely need to be 1100px, maybe you want to work with percentages, a grid, fluid units, etc!) Have fun with it!
- [x] A full bleed background colour (#d5d5d5).
- [] An overlay on hover of images (hint: try using a "to bottom right" linear gradient and percentages to get the triangle look!).
- [] Font awesome icons in the footer, make sure these are links. They should also have a hover state, it could be a colour change or something else, or a combination. Feel free to actually link them to a real destination, such as Toronto's official accounts unless you are customizing yours.
